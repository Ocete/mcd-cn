Numerical Computation
---

In this subject, we have made 2 assignments:

- The first one approaches how **random numbers are generated** in `python` and, after that, approaches the **function approximation** problem (Folder [p1](https://github.com/Ocete/mcd-cn/tree/main/p1))

- In the second one, we use **Monte Carlo** methods to approximate the a-posteriori distribution given by the **Bayes' theorem** in a particular problem about an illness that affects people with a given probability (Folder [p2](https://github.com/Ocete/mcd-cn/tree/main/p2))
